-------------------------------------
Brief guide to CTB fragments
-------------------------------------

   The CTB keeps sending information to the DAQ at all times.
   Its fragments are just random collections of words
   from the trigger board.
   In this context "random" means that the wrapping is not particularly significant
   and it is determined by pure convenience during runtime.

   Hence the structure of fragments is quite simple.
   It is just an array of trigger words.
   The trigger words are defined in the content.h file, see include.

   This overlay classes is just providing the proper readouts and
   casts to the proper word type.
